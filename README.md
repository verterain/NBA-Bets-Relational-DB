# NBA-Bets-Relational-DB

This is a relational database of NBA bets from Polish sportsbook provider BetClic.

As a basketball geek, for a couple of months now I've been collecting and processing a majority of NBA bets to analyze, visualize and draw conclusions on its effectiveness.
For this project, I've been using Oracle SQL Developer, Excel and Power BI.
